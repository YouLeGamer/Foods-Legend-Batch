The proof of concept, and kinda test of Food's Legend: The Souls' Betrayal


The story begins with Food, a teenager who lives in a small village called Greenleaf in the Forest Land. Food loves to explore the woods and collect mushrooms, berries, and herbs. He dreams of seeing the world beyond the forest, but he knows it’s too dangerous. The world is infested by monsters ever since the death of King Harald I, who had an artifact that contained Cain, the King of Monsters. Cain was once a human who became corrupted by his lust for power and tried to conquer the world. He was defeated by Harald I, who sealed him inside the artifact, ~~a golden crown that he wore as a symbol of his authority. The crown~~ also kept the monsters at bay, as they were the physical manifestations of Cain’s anger and sadness.

**Note: Imma find a real artifact. The village will be called "Vertefeuille" in French version.**

~~One day, Food finds a strange map in an old chest in his attic. The map shows the locations of seven temples scattered across the world, each one holding a pure soul. Food is curious about the map and decides to follow it, hoping to find some clues about the artifact and the monsters. He packs his bags and sets off on his adventure.~~

**Note: The map will be given to Food by Edward III**

Along the way, he meets two travelers who become his friends: ~~Lila~~, a cheerful and energetic ~~girl~~ who loves ~~to play music~~ and tell jokes, and Rex, a serious and stoic boy ~~who is skilled with a sword~~ and knows a lot about history and lore. ~~They join Food on his quest, as they also have their own reasons to visit the temples.~~

**Note: Find other names, also, they don't follow Food and they are both men.**

The first temple they reach is in the Mountain Land, a rocky region full of caves and cliffs. The temple is hidden inside a giant statue of an eagle that overlooks the valley. The pure soul there is Courage, and to obtain it, Food and his friends have to face their fears and overcome various obstacles and traps.

On his way to get to the seventh land, Food meets The Wanderer, that is laughing at him because he doesn't know what to do. He shows him the power of his spear, that makes all the monsters around flee while he says "They all forevermore obey the powerful Lord of the Spear!" and vanishes.

**NOTE: NOT BELIEVING THE WANDERER ABOUT THE SPEAR WILL ABORT PACIFIST ROUTE.**

---

The seventh and final temple is in the Crown Land, a mysterious region full of secrets and mysteries. The temple is hidden in a dark and ancient ruin that holds the artifact, ~~the golden crown that once belonged to Harald I and Cain.~~ The pure soul there is Truth, and to obtain it, Food and his friends have to face the ultimate challenge: themselves. They also face some monsters in the ruin, such as shadows, skeletons, and demons. They manage to reach the temple and claim the soul of Truth, which takes the form of a purple gem.

---

After collecting all seven souls, Food and his friends return to the castle to meet King Edward III. ~~The king tells them that he has been waiting for them, and that he knows everything about their quest. He reveals that he is actually a descendant of Cain, and that he has been manipulating them all along. He says that he wants to use the souls to repair the artifact and release Cain, so that they can rule the world together. He says that he broke the artifact himself when he inherited it from his father, who inherited it from Harald I. He says that he has been secretly creating and controlling the monsters, using them to spread fear and chaos across the world. He says that he has been looking for someone who could gather the souls for him, someone who was brave, smart, strong, kind, hopeful, just, and truthful. He says that he found that person in Food.~~

**Note: Edward doesnt become a dark sasuke, sorry gpt.**

---

~~Food and his friends are shocked and angry by this revelation. They refuse to give up the souls to Edward III, and they decide to fight him. However, Edward III is too powerful for them, as he has some of the artifact’s power in his blood. He defeats them easily and takes the souls from them. He then uses them to repair the artifact and puts it on his head. He laughs maniacally as he feels Cain’s presence in his mind.~~

**Note: Same.**

---

*Edward thanks Food for bringing him the seven souls and uses them to repair the artifact. However, the souls were corrupted by the presence of monsters, and do repair the artifact, while also resurrecting Cain.*

---

~~However, things do not go as Edward III planned. Instead of merging with Cain, he is consumed by him.~~ Cain ~~takes over his body and mind, and~~ emerges from the artifact as a monstrous being. He thanks Food and his friends for freeing him, and then tells them that he will destroy them and everything else in the world. He unleashes a wave of dark energy that kills Edward III’s guards and destroys most of the castle. *Cain then possesses Edward's body and uses it like he did with his ancestor during the Infernal War.*

---

Food and his friends are terrified by Cain’s power, but they do not give up hope. They decide to fight him with everything they have left, hoping to stop him somehow. They use their weapons, skills, and magic to attack him, but they barely scratch him. Cain laughs at their efforts and counters with his own attacks, which are devastating and deadly.

---

As they are fighting, they are joined by ~~a mysterious figure who appears out of nowhere. He is wearing a cloak and a hood that hide his face, and he is wielding a spear that glows with a strange light. He introduces himself as~~ The Wanderer, a traveler who has been wandering the world for a long time. He says that he has been following Food and his friends since they started their quest, and that he has been helping them in subtle ways along the way. He says that he knows about Cain and the artifact, and that he has a way to stop him.

---

~~He tells Food and his friends to distract Cain while he prepares his spear. He says that his spear is actually another artifact that was created by Harald I’s brother, who was a great wizard. He says that this artifact can absorb other artifacts’ power, but it can only be used once.~~ He says that he plans to use it to absorb Cain’s power and seal him inside the spear forever.

---

~~Food and his friends agree to follow The Wanderer’s plan. They resume their fight with Cain, trying to keep him busy while The Wanderer charges his spear. They manage to dodge some of Cain’s attacks and land some hits on him, but they also suffer some injuries and lose some energy.~~

---

~~Meanwhile, The Wanderer finishes charging his spear.~~ He waits for the right moment, then throws it at Cain with all his strength. The spear flies through the air like a lightning bolt, piercing Cain’s chest. Cain screams in pain as he feels his power being drained by the spear. The spear glows brighter and brighter as it absorbs Cain’s power, until it becomes too bright to look at.

---

**Then, there is a loud explosion that shakes the whole world.**

---

When the dust settles, Food and his friends see that Cain is gone. All that remains of him is a pile of ashes on the ground. ~~The spear is also gone; it has turned into dust as well.~~

**Note: The spear is still there.**

---

The Wanderer appears before them, smiling faintly. He tells them that they have done it; they have defeated Cain and saved the world. He congratulates them on their courage and determination, and thanks them for their help. ~~He tells them that he has to go now, as his mission is complete. He says that he hopes to see them again someday, and that he wishes them all the best. He then disappears in a flash of light, leaving behind a small gift for each of them: a pendant with a gem that matches the color of the soul they obtained.~~

---

~~Food and his friends are stunned by The Wanderer’s departure, but they are also relieved and happy that the world is safe. They look at the pendants and feel a warm and comforting sensation in their hearts. They realize that the pendants contain some of the power and essence of the souls, and that they can use them to enhance their abilities and protect themselves from harm.~~

---

~~They decide to return to their homes and families, but they promise to keep in touch and visit each other often. They also vow to explore the world and see what has changed after Cain’s defeat. They hope that the world will become a better place, where humans and monsters can live in harmony and peace.~~

---

~~They hug each other and say goodbye, then go their separate ways.~~

---

The story ends with Food arriving at his village, where he is greeted by his parents and friends. They are overjoyed to see him alive and well, and they ask him about his adventure. Food tells them everything that happened, and shows them his pendant. They are amazed by his story, and proud of his achievements. They welcome him back with open arms, and celebrate his return.

---

Food feels happy and fulfilled, as he has accomplished his dream of seeing the world. He also feels grateful for his friends, who have supported him and shared his journey. He thinks of Lila, Rex, and The Wanderer, and wonders what they are doing now. He hopes that they are happy too.

---

He looks at the sky and smiles, as he sees a rainbow forming over the horizon.

The End.
